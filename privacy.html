        <br><br>
        <b>Questions or concerns?</b>

      <h3>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h3>
      <p><b>Information automatically collected</b>
        <br>
        We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.
        <br><br>
        Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.
        <br><br>
        <b>The information we collect includes:</b>
        <br>
        Log and Usage Data.
        <br>
        Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware settings).
        <br><br>
        Device Data.
        <br>
        We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services.

        <br><br>
        Location Data.
        <br>
        We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</p>
        <h3>HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
        <p>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including to save or protect an individual's vital interest. We may process your information when necessary to save or protect an individualâ€™s vital interest, such as to prevent harm.</p>
        <h3>WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
      <p>
        Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers. We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents ("third parties") who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organization apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct. The categories of third parties we may share personal information with are as follows:
        <br>- Ad Networks
        <br>- Data Analytics Services
        <br>- Cloud Computing Services
        <br>- Data Storage Service Providers
        <br>- Website Hosting Service Providers
        <br><br>

        <br>- Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</p>
        <h3>WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</h3>
        <p>The Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications and/or contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, services, or applications. Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.</p>
        <h3>DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h3>
        <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information.</p>
        <h3>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).
        <br><br>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
        <h3>HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
        <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
